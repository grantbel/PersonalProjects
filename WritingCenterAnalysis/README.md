# Writing Center Analysis

At Pomona College, the Writing Center meets with students to aid in brainstorming, writing, and revising student writing. After each writing consultation, the student takes an exit survey about their experience during the consultation. 

For a class project, we acquired the exit survey data and applied machine learning techniques to uncover what makes a writing consultation successful. Our goal was to report these findings to the Director of the Writing Center.

This was a project for a Computational Statistics course at Pomona College taught by Professor Jo Hardin (@hardin47). The research, development, and reporting for the project was completed with the wonderful team of students including Kayla Cummings (@kayla-c), Vanessa Machuca, and myself.

Cheers!
