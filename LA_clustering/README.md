# Clustering LA Neighborhoods
In this analysis I set out to explore the relationships between neighborhoods in Los Angeles through data science techniques. I apply clustering algorithms to gain insight into which Los Angeles neighborhoods form cohesive, similar groups. I then examine what it is that makes them similar, according to the data, and what this says about Los Angeles and, more broadly, urban sociology as a whole.

Read my finished report at neighborhoodClustering.pdf. If you're interested in how I scraped the data, see scrapeLA.py. Cheers!
